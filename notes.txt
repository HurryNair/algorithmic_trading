Python being a slower programming language it is used as a glue language to trigger code in other languages
NumPy for instance has its underlying functions written in C

The Algorithmic trading process

- Collect data
- Develop a hypothesis for a strategy
- Backtest that strategy
- Implement that strategy in production

Project details:

- We'll be using random data
- We will not be executing trades
- We'll be saving recommended trades into excel files

API basics and course configurations:

We will be using the IEX cloud data to gather stock data

API fundamentals:

GET : Lets you get data
POST: Adds data to the database exposed by the API (Create Only)
PUT: Adds and overwrites data in the database exposed by the API(create or replace)
DELETE: Deletes data from the APIs database

Project 1:

Equal weight S&P 500. The S&P 500 is market capitalization weighted. THis means that larger companies 
get a correspondingly larger weight. In this project we build an alternative model where each company has the same
weight.

Project 2:

Quantitative momentum screener

A momentum investing strategy would recommend investing in share that has had higher recent price return

Project 3:

Quantitative value screener

Values investing is investing in stocks that are trading below their perceived intrinsic value
This strategy depends on a concept called multiples. 
Multiples are calculated by dividing a companys stock price bu some measure of the companys net worth like 

- price-to-earnings
- price-to-book-value
- price-to-free-cash-flow

Each of the individual multiples has its pros and cons
One way to minimize the impact of any specific multiple is by using a composite
We'll use a composite of 5 different value metrics
